# English Premier League
The idea for this poject is simple. I am a fan of the English Premier league so I wanted to see if I could predict the scores of matches in the current season based on historical data.

To get the data for this project I used the website football-data.co.uk

* VS Code and Anaconda to write the python code
* Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
